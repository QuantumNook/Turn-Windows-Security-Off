**Version: 1.0**
**Build: 20250602.10**

This application provides a user-friendly interface to configure various Windows security features, prioritizing Group Policy and MDM principles for controlled and reversible management. It's designed to help you adjust settings related to Windows Defender, SmartScreen, User Account Control (UAC), Virtualization-Based Security (VBS), and other system mitigations.

## How to Use

1.  **Access the Application:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This application runs entirely client-side, so you don't need a special web server to use it locally.
2.  **Select Your Configurations:** The application will display a list of Windows security features. Each feature will have a toggle (checkbox or slider) to enable or disable it.
    * **Review Descriptions:** Read the descriptions for each feature carefully to understand its purpose and security implications.
    * **Toggle Settings:** Adjust the toggles according to your desired security posture.
3.  **Generate Scripts:** Once you have made your selections, click the "Generate Configuration Script" button.
4.  **Download and Extract:** Your browser will download a `.zip` file (e.g., `WindowsSecurityConfig.zip`).
    * **Extract this ZIP file** to a location on your computer, such as your Desktop.
    * Inside the ZIP file, you will find two files:
        * `WindowsSecurityConfig.ps1` (or a similar name based on your configuration)
        * `LaunchConfiguration.bat` (or a similar name based on your configuration)
5.  **Run the Configuration:**
    * **IMPORTANT:** You must run the batch file with Administrator privileges.
    * **Right-click** on `LaunchConfiguration.bat`.
    * Select **"Run as administrator"**.
    * Windows User Account Control (UAC) might prompt you for confirmation; click "Yes" to allow it.
    * A command prompt window will open, and the script will execute. It will log its actions to the console.
    * **Pay attention to any messages in the command prompt**, especially if it indicates that a reboot is required for changes to take full effect.
    * Press Enter to close the command prompt window when prompted.

## Reverting Changes

Currently, the application is designed to configure features based on your selections. To revert changes, you would typically:
* Re-run the application and select the opposite settings for the features you wish to revert, then generate and run a new script.
* **Future Enhancement:** A dedicated "Generate Revert Script" functionality might be added in future versions to simplify undoing specific configurations.

## Important Security Notes

* **Administrator Privileges:** The generated scripts modify system-level settings and therefore **require Administrator privileges** to run.
* **Reboots:** Some changes, particularly those related to Virtualization-Based Security (VBS), UAC, or driver blocklists, require a system reboot to take full effect. The script will inform you if a reboot is recommended.
* **Understand the Implications:** Disabling security features can significantly reduce your system's protection against malware, exploits, and data theft. Ensure you understand the security implications of each setting before making changes.
* **Backup:** It is always recommended to create a system restore point or a full backup before applying significant system changes.
